- 👋 Hi, I’m Sean!
- 👀 I'm interested in creative applications of programming — specifically, applications within the field of the performing arts. I would eventually like to develop a wearable microcontroller synthesizer/sound generator, specifically for movers/dancers. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C programming language (and programming in general), using Harvard's cs50x course (see my cs50 repositories). I am also developing an independent study cirriculum based on MITs <a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/">computer science and engineering</a> and <a href="https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18c.php">math</a> courses. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project pertaining to creative applications of programming and arduino-style engineering.
- 📫 You can reach my at my email: seanlally8@gmail.com
