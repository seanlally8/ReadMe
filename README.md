- 👋 Hi, I’m Sean!
- 👀 I'm interested in creative applications of programming — specifically, applications within the field of the performing arts. I would eventually like to develop a wearable microcontroller synthesizer/sound generator, specifically for movers/dancers. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C programming language (and programming in general), using Harvard's cs50x course (see my cs50 repositories). I am also developing an independent study cirriculum based on Stanford's undergraduate <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/undergrad/Requirements.shtml">computer science</a>  cirriculum. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project pertaining to creative applications of programming and arduino-style engineering.
